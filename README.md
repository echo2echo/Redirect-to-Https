# Redirect-to-Https
    
This is code to redirect web page traffic from http to https ( secure web )

Recent versions of apache and letsencrypt redirect to https automatically making this script unnecessary.
 
To reference this javascript file use the following in the head of your webpages

    <script src="./redirectToHttps.js"></script>    
  
Then place the redirectToHttps.js file in the same directory as the file(s) with the script tag or adjust the src location.
